robots.txt file tells the search engines about which file should not be shown to the users




NATAS4

By changing referer header we can get access to a webpage which is denying it

NATAS5
By Changing the cookie from loggedin=0 to loggedin=1

NATAS6
by checking the php code 
we came to know that its  module where secret was, is on includes/secret.inc 
so we visit  its source code by changing source code of the original site by adding /includes/secret.inc

NATAS7
when we change page to home we see link address changes page with  change in "page=..." in its link 
hence through the source code we came to know that the location of the password is in /etc/ file so we change it into 
"page=/etc/......"

NATAS8
we decoded the base64 bin2hex strrev code as follows:
in php compiler:
<?
echo base64_decode (strrev(hex2bin('.....')));
>
NATAS9
In this we will find an interface which demand us to fill a name to get the secret which is password.
But in source code we see no filtering of special symbols 
so here we will use ; to add the line of code which will ultimately show us the PASSWORD
;cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas10

NATAS10

in this only[;][&] are filtered.so by adding .*/etc/natas_pass/natas10# we get our password of this page.
